 This application is intended to determine two properties of a Vetrex:
 1. The scale factor required to reach the vertical extents of the unit's display from its center using the maximum Y strength magnitude (labeled SCALE); and
 2. The X strength magnitude using that scale factor required to reach the horizontal extents of the unit's display from its center (labeled WIDTH).
 As the Vectrex has an aspect ratio of ~0.8, one would expect WIDTH to be approximately equal to 102.
 
 The Y axis of the player 1 analog stick adjusts SCALE while the X axis adjusts WIDTH.
 
 Quickest results are achieved by tilting the stick up until the box displayed is as tall as the screen and then tilting the stick right until the box is as wide as the screen.
 
 The application is not very efficient, but it doesn't need to be!
